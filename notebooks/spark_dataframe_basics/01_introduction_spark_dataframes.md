# Introduction to spark dataframes

- Spark DataFrames hold data in a column and row format
- Each column represents some feature or variable
- Each row represents an individual data point
- Spark began with something called RDD syntax, which was a little ugly and tricky to learn
- DataFrames can be used to apply multiple transformations
- At the end of the transformation calls, we can either show or collect the results
- MLlib API: available API for machine learning in spark
